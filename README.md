## Social Links

Social link handles are normalized consistently across display and verification.
Known platforms use the same normalization rules as input (`normalizeSocialUsername`),
which strips quotes/backslashes, trims whitespace, and removes platform URL prefixes.
Discord remains special-cased (IDs and labels) to preserve verified handle display.
